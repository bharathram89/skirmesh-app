		<p>The SkirMesh System is poised to revolutionize the game of Airsoft. By leveraging wireless mesh
                   networking and RFID player identification technologies the airsoft field becomes a dynamic and interactive
                   part of the gameplay experience.
		</p>
		<p> Three main components comprise the SkirMesh System: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> The Node </li>			
			<li> The Controller </li>
			<li> The Web </li>
		</ul>
		<p> These three components are described below </p>
		
		
		<h2> The Node </h2>
		<p> The individual node is the foundation of the system and allows the player to interact with the
                    SkirMesh System. Several can populate the field and each will take on different functions 
                    based on the type of game.
		</p>

		<p> A player interacts with The Node through the use of an issued RFID tag. Each RFID tag possesses
                    a Unique Identifier (UID) to allow the SkirMesh System to identify who interacted with The Node,
                    what action to take based on that interaction, and finally to award points to that Player based
                    on the scenario.
                </p>
		
		<h3> Node - Physical Description </h3>
		<p> At its core The Node consists of 4 sub-systems </p>
		<ul>
			<li> RFID Reader - sub-system </li>
			<li> Player Feedback - sub-system </li>
			<li> Communications  - sub-system</li>
			<li> Power </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4> RFID Reader - Sub-System </h4>
		<p> The RFID reader is what allows the SkirMesh System to interact with and identify players. The Node
                    will provide an audible beep to indicate that the RFID tag has been read. Because the individual node "knows" 
                    very little about the overall game the RFID reader pulls the UID value from the player's RFID tag and 
                    transmits that back to the Controller for instrucitons on how to handle that interaction.

		<h4> Player Feedback - Sub-System </h4>
		<p> The Player Feedback sub-system consists of 5 RGB LEDs and an audible buzzer. Based on The Node's configuration
                    the RGB patterns change to indicate the status of the node. These patterns will be describe more in-depth under 
                    Node Configuration Settings.
		</p>

		<h4> Communications Sub-System </h4>
		<p> The Communcations sub-system is what allows the individual node to communicate back to the Controller 
                    to ask for instructions on how to handle player interactions and ultimately post information to the internet
                    to display player achievements on the field.
		</p>
		<p> The communications sub-system forms a mesh network (SkirMesh, get it!) between all neighboring nodes. This not
                    not only improves the robustness of the network but also enhances the size of the playing area the SkirMesh System
                    can be deployed on. As long as an idividual Node can communicate with a Node that has a link to the Controller
                    communications will be un-interrupted.
		</p>
		<p> To ensure that the game overall remains syncronized the individual Node makes very few decisions on its own. Instead,
                    all player interactions (scanned RFID tags) are transmitted back to the Controller for instructions. This ensures
                    absolute data integrity and accurate player accomplishment tracking.
		</p>

		<h4> Power </h4>
		<p> All electronics require power and with airsoft fields being our target audience we made the decision to have each node powered
                    by any standard AEG battery pack. If you can put it in the buttstock of your AEG and it has a mini-Tamiya connector it can power
                    a Node.
		</p>

		<h4> Interacting with The Node </h3>
		<p> A lot has been said interacting with the SkirMesh System so let us take a quick moment to show you
                    what that looks like.
		</p>

		<p> Interaction with the node is simple. As mentioned above each player will be issued an RFID tag.
                    This tag takes the form of a waterproof silicone wrist band. Each Node has an area marked with 
                    glow-in-the-dark tape where you will take your wrist band and place it within 1 inch of the marked
                    area. Thats it! The Node has several means of providing feedback to you to show a successful interaction.
		</p>

		<h3> Node Configurations </h3>
		<p> Nodes can be configured to serve different purposes based on the game play requirements. These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Control Points </li>
			<li> Respawn Stations </li>
			<li> Bombs / IEDs </li>
			<li> Team Registration </li>
			<li> Team Query </li>
			<li> UID Registration </li>
		</ul>

		<h4> Control Point </h4>
		
		<p> The control point function is the core function of the Node. We really set out to remove the confusion
                    and disputes that all to often are a result of control point style games in airsoft. This function allows 
                    areas of the airsoft field to be directly mapped to the node. If your team doesn't own the Node for that 
                    territory then your team doesn't own that territory.
		</p>
		
		<p> The Node displays the assigned color of the team of that owns it with its 5 RGB LEDs. Additionally, you can 
                    checkout the field map and see the color of the territory for the Node in question to determine the owner.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Capturing a Control Point </h4>
		
		<p> Here is a scenario on how to capture a Control Point. Lets say you are assigned to RED team, you and your
                    squad come up on a Node. It is displaying 5 BLUE RGBs (it is owned by BLUE team). In order to take it over
                    swipe your RFID tag over the designated area. You will hear short "beep" and then one of 2 things will happen
                    based on the setting for the control points for the game:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Scenario One: If the control points have been configured for immediate capture the lights will all 
			     immediately go RED indicating your team now owns the Node and associated territory. </li>
			<li> Scenario Two: Control Points have been configured for a delayed capture. In this scenario all RGBs will
                             start to blink in the color of the original owning team. As time towards the delayed capture counts down the
                             RGBs will start to turn RED showing your process toward completing the capture. Each RGB indicate 1/5
                             the total capture time so dig in your mission isn't accomplished until all RGBs are the color of your
                             team.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p> For scenario 2, the entire time the RGBs are blinking the Node is considered unstable. If BLUE team is
                    able to eliminate your squad they are able to recapture the Node before RED team is awarded the capture.
                    However, they must now hold the Control Point for the amount of time RED had it in their control. For example,
                    capture time is set for 60 seconds. RED begins the capture and holds it for 36 seconds (The Node will be displaying
                    3 RED RGBs and 2 BLUE RGBs, 36/60 = 3/5). BLUE eliminates all RED players and scans one of their RFID tags, BLUE
                    will now how to hold that control point for 36 seconds before it becomes stable and fully in BLUE teams possession.
		</p>

		<p> To reward players for working as a team we have included a capture assist function. Based on the value of this setting
                    it allows multiple members of the same time to contribute toward the capture of a control point. Once capture of a control
                    point has started each subsequent team member that swipes their RFID tag on the unstable node will reduce the total capture
                    by a fraction of the total capture time.
		</p>

		<p> Example: Capture time  = 60 seconds, Capture Assist = 50%. First player initiates capture, timer starts. 10 seconds into the
                    capture another player from the same team swipes their RFID tag on the unstable node. Capture time has now been reduced by 30
                    seconds resulting in a total time remaining of 20 seconds (60 - 10 - 30 = 20)
		</p> 

                <p> This same behavior also works for a team that is trying to recapture a control point </p>

		<h4> Respawn Stations </h4>
		<p> Respawn Stations are really just an extension of the control point configuration. Based on game requirements
                    certain control points can also serve as respawn stations. This allows certain control points to posses
                    greater tactical value to team commanders as players will not have to travel to a respawn spawn station
                    on the other side of the field. 
		</p>

		<p> Here is how the respawn mechanic works. After being elminated you would return to the nearest control point that
                    also serves as a respawn station. You will then hold your RFID tag over the Node until all RGBs flash red.
                    By doing that you have just deactivated your RFID tag from interacting with any other non respawn station nodes and
                    the Controller is currently tracking you as "dead". <b> THIS IS IMPORTANT PLEASE KEEP READING! </b> In order to get
                    your tag reactivated you need to wait for the cool down timer timer to elapse. You can check the status of this timer
                    by holding your RFID tag over the Node and seeing how many red lights appear. Again each red RGB indicates 1/5
                    the total time toward the cool down being completed. Only when all 5 RGBs flash green is
                    your RFID tag re-activated and able to interact with other nodes on the field.
		</p>

		<h4> Bombs / IEDs </h4>
		<p> When configured as a Bomb/IED players are able to arm or disarm them by swiping their RFID tag.
                    The arming, fuse, and difusing time are all configurable by the controller.

		<h4> Arming </h4>
		<p> To arm the bomb the player would hold their RFID band over the Node for the duration of time set
                    by the arming parameter.  As the player holds their RFID band over the Node the RGBs will start to
                    turn orange again following the 1/5 rule explained above. Once all RBGs turn orange they will immediately
                    all turn red and the bomb is armed. The red RGBs will turn off 1 by 1 based on total time remaining.
                    Onces all RGBs turned off the bomb will <b> "EXPLODE!" </b> The Node will flash all 5 RGBs red and the
                    siren will give off a continuous and extremely annoying tone. Power cycling the Node is the only way
                    to reset the bomb.
		</p>

		<h4> Disarming </h4>
		<p> Disarming follows the same method as above. However, the Node does not give feedback on the amount of
                    of time is left to disarming is complete. Knowing what the disarm time is and looking at the lights remaining
                    is the only way of knowing if you will be successful in disarming or become collateral damage.
		</p>
	    	
		<h4> Team Registration </h4>
		<p> Airsoft is a team sport and the Team Registration functionality allows the SkirMesh System to assign players
                    and their associated UID to a team. The to identify a Node that is in the team register mode it will have 
                    2 RGBs illuminated the color of the team that they will assign the player to.
                </p>
		<p> To assign yourself to a team find the Node that is displaying your team color and swipe your RFID tag. The Node
                    will provide a short beep indicating successful assignment to that team. Thats it! Now all your accomplishments
                    on the field will be associated with your team.
                </p>
		<p> Keep in mind currently all SkirMesh game modes require a player to be part of a team so if you are unsure if
                    your RFID tag is associated with a team either re-register or find a Team Query node(explained below).
		</p>

		<h4> Team Query </h4>
		<p> A team query Node has just the single white LED illuminated. When you swipe your RFID tag it will display
                    your team color on the first 2 RGBs and the last RGB will be green if you are being tracked as "alive" or red
                    if "dead."
